You may run all experiments by updating your OpenAI API key in the
data/api_key.txt file, and running `python3 main.py` from the repository root.

Note that the code does not run the experiment if the experiment results are 
available in the results directory, so you will need to empty that directory if 
you wish to re-run the experiments. The repository includes the results of all 
experiments already.
